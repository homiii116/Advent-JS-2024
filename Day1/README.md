# Instraction
## Santa Claus 🎅 has received a list of magical numbers representing gifts 🎁, but some of them are duplicated and must be removed to avoid confusion. Additionally, the gifts must be sorted in ascending order before being delivered to the elves.

## Your task is to write a function that receives a list of integers (which may include duplicates) and returns a new list without duplicates, sorted in ascending order.
